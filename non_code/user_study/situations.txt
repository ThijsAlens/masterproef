Create a devicetype called "door" with the following states:
    - "opened"
    - "closed"

Create a devicetype called "motion_sensor" with the following states:
    - "motion_detected"
    - "no_motion_detected"

Create a new area called "living_room", it is part of the "home".

Create a new device called "living_room_door" which is of the type "door", it is located in the area called "living_room".

Create a new device called "living_room_motion_sensor" which is of the type "motion_sensor", it is located in the area called "living_room".

Create a new rule that states that if the "living_room_motion_sensor" is in state "motion_detected", the "living_room_door" should be in the state "opened".

Save your blocks and see if they function as you imagined in the Interactive Consultant.

------------------------------------------------------------------ CASE 1 -----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model the home with its rooms and devices given in CASE_1.

The devicetype light consists of 2 states: 'light_on' and 'light_off'.
The devicetype light_switch consists of 2 states: 'light_switch_on' and 'light_switch_off'.

The home should follow the rules below:
    - light_3 should turn on, if light_switch_1 is on.
    - light_1 and light_2 should turn off, if light_switch_1 is turned on.
    - light_1 and light_2 should turn on, if light_switch_1 is turned off.
    - light_3 should turn off, if light_switch_1 is off.

------------------------------------------------------------------ CASE 2 -----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model the home with its rooms and devices given in CASE_2.

The devicetype light consists of 2 states: 'light_on' and 'light_off'.
The devicetype fan consists of a range of numbers: 0 to 100.
The devicetype motion_sensor consists of 2 states: 'motion_sensor_on', 'motion_sensor_off'.
The devicetype temperature_sensor consists of a range of numbers: 0 to 50.

The home should follow the rules below:
    - light_3 should turn on, if motion_sensor_1 or motion_sensor_2 is active.
    - fan_1 should turn on to 80, if the temperature_sensor is 30
    - light_1 and light_2 should turn off, if the time is 8.

------------------------------------------------------------------ CASE 3 -----------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model the home with its rooms and devices given in CASE_3.

The devicetype light consists of 2 states: 'light_on' and 'light_off'.
The devicetype light_switch consists of 2 states: 'light_switch_on' and 'light_switch_off'.
The devicetype alarm consists of 2 states: 'alarm_on' and 'alarm_off'.
The devicetype motion_sensor consists of 2 states: 'motion_sensor_on' and 'motion_sensor_off'.
The devicetype variable_light consists of a range of numbers: 0 to 100.
The devicetype variable_light_switch consists of a range of numbers: 0 to 100.
The devicetype blind consists of 3 states: 'opened', 'half_opened' and 'closed'.

The home should follow the rules below:
    - 'light_1'  and 'light_2' should turn on, if either light_switch_1 or light_switch_2 is toggled.
    - all the lights of type 'light' should turn on and the alarm should turn on, if the time is 2 and 'motion_sensor_1' is in the state 'motion_sensor_on'.
    - 'variable_light_switch_1' controls the state of 'variable_light_1'.
    - 'variable_light_1' should turn off (value = 0) and 'light_3' should turn on if it the time is 4.
    - 'variable_light_1' should have a value of 40 and 'blind_1' should be half_opened, if the time is 6.
