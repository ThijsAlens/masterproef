@article{CNL,
    abstract = {What is here called has traditionally been given many different names. Especially during the last four decades, a wide variety of such languages have been designed. They are applied to improve communication among humans, to improve translation, or to provide natural and intuitive representations for formal notations. Despite the apparent differences, it seems sensible to put all these languages under the same umbrella. To bring order to the variety of languages, a general classification scheme is presented here. A comprehensive survey of existing English-based CNLs is given, listing and describing 100 languages from 1930 until today. Classification of these languages reveals that they form a single scattered cloud filling the conceptual space between natural languages such as English on the one end and formal languages such as propositional logic on the other. The goal of this article is to provide a common terminology and a common model for CNL, to contribute to the understanding of their general nature, to provide a starting point for researchers interested in the area, and to help developers to make design decisions.},

    abstract = {Attempto Controlled English (ACE) is a controlled natural language, i.e. a precisely defined subset of English that can automatically and unambiguously be translated into first-order logic. ACE may seem to be completely natural, but is actually a formal language, concretely it is a first-order logic language with an English syntax. Thus ACE is human and machine understandable. ACE was originally intended to specify software, but has since been used as a general knowledge representation language in several application domains, most recently for the semantic web. ACE is supported by a number of tools, predominantly by the Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) that translates ACE texts into Discourse Representation Structures (DRS), a variant of first-order logic. Other tools include the Attempto Reasoner RACE, the AceRules system, the ACE View plug-in for the Protege ontology editor, AceWiki, and the OWL verbaliser.},

@misc{IDPStructuredBlockbasedEditor,
    abstract = {The process of expressing our thoughts using some language is extremely complex. However, we can distinguish two main ingredients: knowing the language's syntactical rules of the language and constructing sentences that have an adequate meaning. The construction of sentences can only be accomplished when we are aware of the grammar of the language. Learning to construct correct sentences is hard and would be easier if we do not have to think about the syntax.   In this thesis, we are focussing on first-order logic with certain extensions which has a complex syntax with a lot of different symbols that have to be placed in the correct sequence. Such a formal language can be used by domain experts to formalise their knowledge to create a knowledge base that can be used to solve problems. To utilise the formal language, the experts have to learn semantics and the syntax of the new language. The goal of this thesis is to overcome the need for syntax knowledge of the formal language.   Previous studies have tried to solve this problem by using the DMN standard or controlled natural languages, such as Attempto Controlled English and Processable English. These solutions still require the domain expert to learn syntax, which is different from the formal language. In this work, the impact of syntax in the knowledge base specification process is examined by comparing a text editor with a structured, block-based editor. In a block-based editor, interlocking blocks can be connected to create first-order logic statements. While editing, the blocks are synchronously translated to the corresponding first-order logic syntax. Additionally, the possibilities and impact of translating the blocks to other formats, such as natural language and abstract syntax trees, are examined. In this thesis, the impact of syntax free editors and different representations of code on the capability to produce correct formalisations are investigated.  To answer the scientific questions, experiments were conducted in which participants compared the block-based editor with a regular text editor. During the experiments, the impact of the syntax in the process of formalising sentences has been investigated as well as the impact of providing the translation to other formats.},

The different forms of inference provided by the knowledge base system allow for flexible decision enactment.

@misc{IDPZ3ReasoningEngine,
    abstract = {An important sign of intelligence is the capacity to apply a body of knowledge to a particular situation in order to not only derive new knowledge, but also to determine relevant questions or provide explanations. Developing interactive systems capable of performing such a variety of reasoning tasks for the benefits of its users has proved difficult, notably for performance and/or development cost reasons. Still, recently, a reasoning engine, called IDP3, has been used to build such systems, but it lacked support for arithmetic operations, seriously limiting its usefulness. We have developed a new reasoning engine, IDP-Z3, that removes this limitation, and we put it to the test in four knowledge-intensive industrial use cases. This paper describes FO(·) (aka FO-dot), the language used to represent knowledge in the IDP3 and IDP-Z3 system. It then describes the generic reasoning tasks that IDP-Z3 can perform, and how we used them to build a generic user interface, called the Interactive Consultant. Finally, it reports on the four use cases. In these four use cases, the interactive applications based on IDP-Z3 were capable of intelligent behavior of value to users, while having a low development cost (typically 10 days) and an acceptable response time (typically below 3 seconds). Performance could be further improved, in particular for problems on larger domains.},

abstract = {The ideas of smart home and home automation have been proposed for many years. However, when discussing homes of the future, related studies have usually focused on deploying various smart appliances (or devices) within a home environment and employing those appliances automatically by pre-defined procedures. The difficulties of supporting user-configurable automation are due to the complexity of various dynamic home environments. Moreover, within their home domains, users usually think semantically; for example, “I want to turn off all the lights on the second floor”. This paper proposes a semantic home automation system, USHAS (User-configurable Semantic Home Automation System), which adopts Web Service and WSBPEL for executing automated process; OWL and OWL-S for defining home environments and service ontology; and a self-defined markup language, SHPL (Semantic Home Process Language), for describing semantic processes.}

Nevertheless, it still remains a challenge to assist the inhabitants of a SH in performing the ``right'' action(s) at the ``right'' time in the ``right'' place. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a novel logical framework for cognitive behavioural modelling, reasoning and assistance based on a highly developed logical theory of actions - the Event Calculus. Cognitive models go beyond data-centric behavioural models in that they govern an inhabitant's behaviour by reasoning about its knowledge, actions and environmental events. In our work we outline the theoretical foundation of such an approach and describe cognitive modelling of SH. We discuss the reasoning capabilities and algorithms of the cognitive SH model and present the details of the various tasks it can support. A system architecture is proposed to illustrate the use of the framework in facilitating assistive living. We demonstrate the perceived effectiveness of the approach through presentation of its operation in the context of a real world daily activity scenario.}
