  {"id":"aertsTacklingDMNChallenges2020","abstract":"This paper describes an extension to the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard, called cDMN. \nDMN is a user-friendly, table-based notation for decision logic. \ncDMN aims to enlarge the expressivity of DMN in order to solve more complex problems, while retaining DMN’s goal of being readable by domain experts.\nWe test cDMN by solving the most complex challenges posted on the DM Community website.\nWe compare our own cDMN solutions to the solutions that have been submitted to the website and find that our approach is competitive, both in readability and compactness. \nMoreover, cDMN is able to solve more challenges than any other approach.","author":[{"family":"Aerts","given":"Bram"},{"family":"Vandevelde","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Vennekens","given":"Joost"}],"citation-key":"aertsTacklingDMNChallenges2020","contributor":[{"family":"Gutiérrez Basulto","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Kliegr","given":"Tomáš"},{"family":"Soylu","given":"Ahmet"},{"family":"Giese","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Roman","given":"Dumitru"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-57977-7","ISSN":"0302-9743","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","source":"kuleuven.limo.libis.be","title":"Tackling the DMN Challenges with cDMN: A Tight Integration of DMN and Constraint Reasoning","title-short":"Tackling the DMN Challenges with cDMN","type":"paper-conference"}
