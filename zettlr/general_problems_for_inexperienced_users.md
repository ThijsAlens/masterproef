#general problems non-developers encounter when learning a new language
There are a lot of possible obstacles when it comes to learning a new language. You'll need to learn the vocabulary, the grammar, how a sentence can mean different things based on it's context… The same is true for learning a new programming language. This is espesially difficult for people who don't have any experience in the wonderfull world of programming.
##Complex symbols and ways to think
A programming language has a lot of symbols, think of a lot of parenticies, semi-colluns, stars… This could be very intimidating for a new user. A way to make this more approachable is to split the learning of the syntax and the semantics. If there is a way to split these, the user could first familiarize itself to one espect, before learning the other. This way it can be a lot less intimidating to learn a language. (mss voorbeeld van de populariteit van Python vs andere PLs).
FO(.) especially can be intimidating. It is not very readable by someone that has never encountered FO logic before.
