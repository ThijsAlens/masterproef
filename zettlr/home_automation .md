# Home automation
## What is home automation
Home automation is a very brought term that is used when talking about automating a home. It can be very simple like automaticially turning on a light when entering a room, to very complex problems like tuning the temperature of the house depending on various variables. It also refers to the security of a home: when should the security camera automaticially record, when should the doors automaticially lock, what should happen if the alarm goes of… Automaticially doing things, like automaticially making coffee at the start of the day, is also considered home automation. It can also be used to control the energy usage throughout the day to reduce costs.

Home automation consists of _a few_ main parts:
Smart home devices
Some kind of smart hub/server
An application

### Smart home devices
A smart home device (or smart devices) can be either of two things: a sensor or an actuator. A sensor can detect an event while an actuator can do something based on a trigger. A simple example can be a motion detector (sensor) that automaticially turns on a light (actuator) when there is movement. Depending on the device that is used, their may be some more advanced (smart) features in them. For example, the light could come with a sensor that mesures the brightness of a room, which automaticially adjusts the brightness of the light based on how much natural light is comming in. This is rarely used, because most of the time the user would like to configure this themself. The smart devices are, in other words, the actual hardware behind a smart home which, in most of the cases, do not have any smart home logic in them.
### Smart hub/server
The smart hub is a central device that forms a connection between the complex hardware of the devices and the user. It's function is to recieve data from the sensors and sent commands to actuators, a central hub for the devices so to speak. This hub can be provided by a manufacturer of smart devices specifficially for their devices, or it can be a generic one that tries to be as complient with as many devices as possible.
### Application
The application is a way for the user to configure their home. Most of the time this is done by creating a GUI (graphical user interface) in which the user can create automations, see the status of devices, see what automations are running, easily communicate with the devices…
